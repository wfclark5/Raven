"""Host-side launcher for Raven-Code -- the B side, on installed raven.

The retired vendored Raven-Code carried a whole fork
checkout; this product carries its assets only, and as of the exec-target
swap the process it starts is installed raven itself. Two hostings, the
fork launcher's own pair:

- ``--acp`` (what the roster row spawns): render the config, then exec
  ``python -m raven acp`` on this interpreter, so the server inherits this
  pid, process group and stdio, and every turn runs through the same
  assembly door (build_runtime) as the host's TUI and gateway.
- ``--task`` / ``--prompt-file``: the one-turn CLI adjudication hosting.
  One call is one turn; the same ``--session <id>`` across calls is a
  multi-turn conversation. The launcher renders, runs ``raven agent -m``
  on the installed raven, and owes the caller the fork launcher's five
  commitments: a task-first preamble, a transcript verdict (the answer is
  what the agent committed, never a replay of a previous turn's), a
  working-tree footprint footer, a workspace pinned per conversation with
  a contradicting ``--workspace`` refused, and exit 124 for a launcher
  kill kept distinct from exit 1.

The fork's coding conduct rides the rendered config now, not the process
environment: ``plugins.dirs`` names the code-flow plugin and its slice flips
the flow on (per D6). Worktree isolation retired with the write gate: nothing
locks a checkout, and a session learns from the flow when other sessions are
working beside it. The launch contract is otherwise the fork launcher's: refuse
without any LLM key before any process starts, seed the fork's TOOLS.md
wording into the state partition, refresh untouched seeds, keep secrets out of
the published config and in a 0600 rendered copy whose parent decides the data dir.

Serving ACP, stdout belongs to the protocol and diagnostics go to stderr.
Hosting a CLI turn, stdout carries the answer and nothing else -- the
caller's backend folds non-empty stderr into the conversation -- so
diagnostics go to ``launcher.log`` in the conversation's state directory;
``--verbose`` mirrors them for a human running this by hand.
