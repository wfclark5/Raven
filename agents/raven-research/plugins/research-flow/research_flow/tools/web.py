"""Web tools: ``web_search`` and ``web_fetch`` for the research flow.

These replace the kernel's built-in tools of the same names. Both route through a
vendor the deployment picks, the same seven search and five fetch backends the
built-ins offer, declared in :data:`SEARCH_PROVIDERS` and
:data:`FETCH_PROVIDERS`; Serper and Jina remain the defaults and their wire
traffic is byte-identical to what this pair has always sent. What the pair adds
over the built-ins is the research harness around the call - the per-turn replay
cache and repeat notice, snippet and cross-query dedup, the saturation rule, the
evidence round, the digest path, a bounded retry policy, and a ledger row for
every call.

A vendor that serves no result offset cannot answer the saturation rule's page-2
rung, so ``SearchProviderSpec.paginates`` tells the rule up front rather than
letting it escalate into requests that come back identical.

Per-session state
-----------------
The kernel builds ONE instance of each tool for every session it serves, where the
fork built one per session. Everything the fork kept as mutable per-turn state on
``self`` - the retry budget, the replay cache, the seen sets, the counters, and the
tool's own ``SearchSaturation`` / ``EvidenceRound`` instances - therefore lives in a
per-session slot instead. The slot is selected by the ``ContextVar``
:data:`_SESSION`, which the flow hook sets through :func:`set_current_session`
before the model call; tool coroutines run in that same task context, so the slot
they see is the session's. The empty key (the ``ContextVar`` default) is a valid
slot, so a tool used outside the hook still works, single-session.

The saturation rule and the evidence round are per session too. The constructor
takes *factories* - zero-argument callables returning a fresh instance - and calls
one the first time a session's slot is built, from inside that session's context.
A factory that has to hand back the instance a session's gate chain already shares
(the evidence round is opened by the verify gate and spent here) can close over
:func:`current_session` to look it up.

``start_turn`` resets the CURRENT session's slot, which is what the fork's loop did
for its one session at the top of every turn. The hook calls it on turn start.

    One implementation, two callers: the client-side ledger's ``ok`` column and

    contract is "search returns once a page is opened" and the ledger is what an
    acceptance check reads to decide whether that ever happened. Two spellings of
    "did the fetch work" drifting apart would show up as a gate that looks stuck
    in a ledger that says it should have opened - a disagreement with no runtime

    A body that is not a JSON object counts as a failure. That is the same
    caliber the ledger already used, and it is the safe direction here: an
    unparseable body cannot be shown to be a page, and a gate that released on
    one would release on every malformed response.

    ``raw_decode``, not ``loads``: the envelope is recognised even when a
    harness note trails it. ``loads`` demands that the JSON be the WHOLE
    string, and the fetch-gate and sufficiency seams read a message body that
    several observers are entitled to write on - ``BudgetNoteObserver`` appends
    ``[budget: iteration N/M | context ~P%]`` to the newest tool result, the
    fetch floor and the gate append their notes. ``unwrap_untrusted`` now drops
    what follows the fence's close marker, so those seams normally hand this a
    clean envelope; this is the second line, for a body that reaches a caller
    annotated but unfenced. The ledger is unaffected either way - it is handed
