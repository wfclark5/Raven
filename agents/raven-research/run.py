"""Host-side launcher for the Raven-Research ACP server -- the B side.

The retired vendored Raven-Research carried a whole fork checkout; this
product carries none. It renders its config and execs the
installed raven's own ``raven acp``, so every turn runs through the same
assembly door (build_runtime) as the host's TUI and gateway. The machinery
of rendering lives in the launcher library
(``raven.config.product_render``); what remains here is this product's own
half -- its tables (which secrets go where, what its modes are called, which
overlay keys exist) and its judgement (how a mode's budget resolves, the
flow prompts, refusing to launch without a search key).

The rendered copy lands under the state root and the location is
load-bearing: raven derives its data dir from the config file's own parent,
so transcripts, cache and logs follow the rendered file. The workspace is
pinned under the same root -- the schema default is the host raven's own
workspace, which this agent must not share.

Three deliberate differences from the vendored launcher, all of them the new
architecture doing the job the fork used to:

* the home is answered by the path paper (``raven.home``), never re-derived;
* identity is a workspace asset -- raven reads
  ``agent_memory/profile/soul.md``, so ``soul.md`` beside this file is
  copied there on first launch -- not a config override;
* modes are overlays: ``modes/*.json`` diffs become ``acp.modes`` entries a
  client's picker shows, applied per session over the baseline flow config
  instead of being compiled into the loop the way the fork did.

After rendering, this process execs ``python -m raven acp`` on its own
interpreter (the row's ``{PYTHON}`` resolves at install time to one that
imports raven), so the server inherits this pid, process group and stdio.
stdout belongs to the protocol; every diagnostic goes to stderr.
