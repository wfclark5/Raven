"""Host-side launcher for the Raven-PPT ACP server -- the B side, swapped.

The engine this launcher serves is installed raven's own: the deck capability
arrives as the ppt-engine wheel (plugins-dist/ppt-engine), discovered through
the ``raven.plugins`` entry-point group -- eleven deck tools and the
material/deck turn hook, with the eight templates as sha256-pinned package
data. The vendored fork checkout is retired; the A side of the A/B verification
survives as byte snapshots under ``tests/fixtures/vendored_fork/``.

The launch contract is still the fork launcher's ACP half: refuse without any
LLM key, give an own key to every provider block, honour PPT_MODEL/PPT_API_BASE
on the own-key branch only, size the context window from the endpoint that
will serve whichever model won, render into a 0600 copy whose parent decides
the data dir. Three renders are this hosting's own, each the trunk
runtime's seat for something the fork engine did per checkout: the agent home
is pinned under the state root (the fork fenced per-session workspaces inside
its own process; a pooled loop reads identity, sessions and skills from ONE
home, and that home must not be the host's), the engine's skill directory is
mounted through ``skillForge.localDirs`` (the fork shipped the skill inside
its checkout; the wheel ships it inside the package), and the retired
``tools.ppt`` block is dropped from an operator's carried config with a
one-line hint at its successor (the plugin slice renders the same knobs).
stdout belongs to the protocol; every diagnostic goes to stderr.
