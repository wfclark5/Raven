"""Which window is watching which campaign, and which task that campaign is.

An ops home holds every campaign of an instance, and with no ``--config`` that is
one home for every window. The campaign a call means was inferred by counting
directories in it: exactly one meant that one, anything else meant "say which
one". Two windows each watching an experiment is the ordinary two-window case, so
both of them got the error -- the whole of "you cannot watch two experiments at
once".

Two identities answer two different questions, and neither substitutes for the
other:

  - **the window** (session key, ``tui:<id>``, minted per window by
    ``session.create``) tells two open windows apart. It dies with its window.
  - **the task** (a fingerprint of the statement the operator handed over) is what
    a *new* window has when the old one is gone. The state is on disk precisely so
    another window can pick the watch up, and this is how it recognises which one
    to pick up without being told.

So the lookup is: what this window claimed, then what this task belongs to, then
ask. The last tier is the only one anybody has to act on, and it is reached once
per window at most.

Deliberately plain files, rewritten whole. This is an index, not a record anything
is judged on -- every campaign's own directory remains the truth, which is why a
lost or corrupt file falls back to the older rule rather than failing.
