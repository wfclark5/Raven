"""Host-side launcher for the Raven-Oncall ACP server -- the B side.

The retired vendored Raven-Oncall carried a whole fork checkout; this
product carries none. It renders its config and execs the
installed raven's own ``raven acp``, so every turn runs through the same
assembly door (build_runtime) as the host's TUI and gateway. The machinery
of rendering lives in the launcher library
(``raven.config.product_render``); what remains here is this product's own
half -- its tables (which secrets go where) and its judgement (refusing to
launch without any LLM key, pointing the machine registry at the owner's
file, seeding the on-call guide into the workspace).

The rendered copy lands under the state root and the location is
load-bearing: raven derives its data dir from the config file's own parent,
so transcripts, cache and logs follow the rendered file. The workspace is
pinned under the same root -- the schema default is the host raven's own
workspace, which this agent must not share.

What the vendored launcher also hosted does not come back here: the
resident wake shell's duties pass to resident trunk hosts and the product
plugin's contributions, and the one-turn CLI adjudication path retires with
its only callers (the wake shell and the fork benchmarks). This launcher
serves ACP, nothing else.

After rendering, this process execs ``python -m raven acp`` on its own
interpreter (the row's ``{PYTHON}`` resolves at install time to one that
imports raven), so the server inherits this pid, process group and stdio.
stdout belongs to the protocol; every diagnostic goes to stderr.
