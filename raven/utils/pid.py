"""Whether a process id still names a running process.

``os.kill(pid, 0)`` is the POSIX existence probe, and on Windows it is not a
probe at all. CPython implements ``os.kill`` there as ``TerminateProcess``, so
signal 0 never reaches a liveness check: every pid but the caller's own comes
back ``OSError`` with ``ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER``. Read as "gone" -- which is
what the hand-rolled probes in this tree did -- it makes a running process
invisible, and a caller that cannot see a process cannot stop one.

Windows answers the question with ``OpenProcess`` and a zero-timeout wait, the
pair ``raven/updates/upgrade.py`` already uses to watch a parent exit.
