    The second of two layers. The first -- `which` plus, for acp, the handshake --

    It cannot answer whether the agent can *work*: ACP has no authenticated-state
    field, so an agent that defers its credential to the first model call opens a
    session happily and fails afterwards. Six of thirteen registry agents measured
    on 2026-09-07 did exactly that.

    only from an explicit switch-on and never from a listing. A Kimi Code ping
    that fails without a reason is asked once more in print mode
    (`kimi_code.explain`), which is a second call only when the failure has
    passed in between.

    It runs on a pool of its own, closed on the way out. The shared pool keys a
    connection on its launch arguments and ``cwd`` falls back to the caller's
    workspace, which here is a fresh temporary directory per call -- so a ping on
    the shared pool never matches a held connection and ``acquire`` retires every
    connection of that agent before opening its own. Measured 2026-09-20 against
    a live adapter: a second Connect pressed while the first was still running
    took the first one's connection down, and the first came back "did not answer
    a test message" for a failure raven had caused; a ping fired while that agent
    was serving a real run would have taken that run's connection with it.

    """Run an acp agent to reach its verdict, and remember what its handshake said.

    Two measurements, in that order, because they answer different questions.

    The handshake -- ``initialize`` plus ``session/new`` -- answers whether the
    agent is installed, speaks ACP and will open a session, and it is free. So it
    goes first, and a refusal there is the verdict: no prompt is spent on an
    agent that cannot take one.

    What it cannot answer is whether the agent *works*. ACP carries no
    authenticated-state field, so one that defers its credential to the first
    model call opens a session happily and fails afterwards; six of thirteen
    registry agents measured on 2026-09-07 did exactly that, and this test called
    every one of them ready. So the verdict is the agent's own answer to
    ``PROBE_PROMPT`` -- the bar `cli` has always had, and the one the enable gate
    already holds a connect to, which is what makes a green Test and a successful
    Connect mean the same thing.

    Two consequences worth stating. It **spends one call on the agent's own
    quota**, which this test did not before; it is reached only from an explicit
    press, since `subagents.test` is `run_test`'s one caller, and never from a
    listing or the boot backfill. And it launches the agent twice, because the
    handshake and the ping have different reuse rules -- the ping runs on a pool
    of its own so that it cannot retire a connection a real run is holding.

    Always connects live, deliberately skipping the probe: the probe reports the
    *recorded* snapshot, so consulting it here would replay a stale failure (one
    slow first `npx` download) as this test's verdict forever. A truly absent
    executable still fails fast -- launch raises before any timeout waits.
