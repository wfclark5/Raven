"""Agent rows discovered from the ``agents/`` product tree.

Raven ships agent products under ``agents/`` -- one folder per product, each a
launcher (``run.py``) that renders the product's config and serves it on the
installed raven, plus a ``subagent.json`` manifest describing how to invoke
it. This module turns that tree into table rows so a raven that *has* the tree
offers them without anyone registering them by hand.

Discovery, deliberately, rather than a hard-coded list: adding a product is
then adding a folder, which is the same reason the onboarding wizard's
discovery scans instead of naming them. And discovery only -- nothing here
writes config. A row is materialized from the manifest on every start, so a
folder whose manifest changes (a new command template after an upgrade) is
picked up without a stored copy of the old one to contradict it.

Every ordinary install has the tree: a wheel carries it at ``raven/agents``,
and :func:`_install_packaged_tree` copies it out to the raven home on first
use, which is why the packaged branch of :func:`agents_root` is live rather
than vestigial. Where it is absent -- a wheel built from an sdist, which has
neither the tree nor a ``.git`` to enumerate it from -- there is nothing to
discover and the table is exactly what it was before this module existed. That
is the intended degradation, not a gap.

**Readiness decides ``enabled``, not whether the row exists.** A folder whose
launcher file is gone, or whose declared engine wheel is not importable,
cannot start: "Registering an agent that cannot start puts a name in the
roster the dispatching model will pick and then fail on." Dropping the row
entirely would hide the folder from the operations view too, where "present
but not set up" is exactly what a user needs to see. So it is listed and
disabled, with the reason on the row. A missing credential is deliberately
*not* a readiness reason any more: the launchers inherit the host's provider
block when the folder holds no key of its own, and a launcher that finds
nothing anywhere refuses loudly at dispatch -- a discovery-time credential
verdict would be a second reader of that fact, free to disagree with the one
that rules.

This module owns the two facts about where the tree is and what state a
folder is in; the onboarding wizard imports them rather than keeping its own
answers. Two readers that disagree about whether a folder is ready would offer
to set up one this refuses to advertise.
