"""Why Kimi Code would not answer, when its ACP server does not say.

Kimi Code 2.1.0 reports two kinds of failure over ACP, measured 2026-09-24
against a stand-in endpoint answering each status, and against a real account
whose plan does not include it:

- A provider refusing the credential (401, 403) comes back as a JSON-RPC error,
  ``-32000 Authentication required: <status> <the provider's message>``, on
  ``session/prompt``.
- A session it cannot start -- never signed in, no model, a provider with no
  key, a config file it cannot parse, a default model that is not configured --
  comes back as a bare ``-32000 Authentication required`` on ``session/new``,
  with nothing saying which.

Everything else the provider says is swallowed. A sign-in the auth server will
no longer refresh, 402, 404, 400, a spent quota, a content filter: the turn ends
``end_turn`` (``refusal`` for the filter) with no content and nothing on stderr.
What it counts as retryable -- 429, 5xx, a host it cannot reach, a reply it
cannot read -- it retries for about two and a half minutes first, which the
connect's wait does not outlast; that one is the general `silent` verdict
(`presets.DIAGNOSE_HINTS`), not this module's.

`kimi -p` prints the same failures in words, as ``error: failed to run prompt:
...`` on stderr, and within a second for every one it does not retry. So where
the ACP answer carries no reason, this asks Kimi Code once more in print mode --
what a reader told to run it in a terminal would see -- and reads that line.
It is only ever done for the preset's own row, launched by the preset's own
command: a row's command is its operator's execution config, and running its
executable a second way is not this module's to decide.
