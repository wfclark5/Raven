"""Third-party CLI agent backend: shell out to an external agent (claude code,
codex, ...) as a spawned sub-agent.

Runs on the host rather than through the sandbox executor - these CLIs need the
host's auth, config, and PATH, which is the login shell's rather than raven's
own. Prompt delivery: a ``{prompt}`` token in the
command is substituted as a single argv token (injection-safe), ``{prompt_file}``
as a path to a file holding the prompt; with neither, the prompt goes on the
child's stdin.

With ``resume_command`` set the agent is stateful: an instance handle is bound
to the CLI's own session id in :mod:`raven.agent.subagent.instances`, so a later
spawn with the same handle resumes that session.
