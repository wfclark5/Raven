"""Harness custody for a long local command: a tracked child, a managed log.

``exec`` runs a command synchronously and caps it, because a command that
outlives the call has nowhere to be while the loop waits. A download, an
``rsync`` of a code tree, a ``tar`` of a log directory -- long, mechanical,
and spending no GPU budget -- fits neither the cap (it is genuinely minutes)
nor ``ops_submit`` (that is for GPU jobs on registered machines, with a
ledger and a budget). This is that missing home: the command runs detached
on THIS computer, its output goes to a file the harness names, and the
process is tracked so it can be looked at and is reaped when the session
ends.

Why not ``nohup`` in the command string: nohup leaves work running but hands
back nothing. No task to look at, a log path the model invents and then
loses (measured 2026-09-02: a 257-byte crash log nobody was routed to), and
a child that outlives the session with no one tracking it (measured
2026-09-02: an orphan held a GPU at 100% after its caller was gone). The
custody here is the value; the boolean is only its handle.

Not a wake. The main loop is turn-based, so a task that finishes after the
turn ends has no live turn to notify; a caller keeps its turn alive and reads
the log, or checks back on a later turn. Work that needs to WAKE a watching
loop when it lands is a job for the on-call agent's ops_submit, not this.
