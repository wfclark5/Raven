"""Web tools: web_search and web_fetch, each behind a selectable vendor.

One tool per capability, several backends behind each. What differs per vendor
is the request it expects and the payload it answers with; everything the model
sees -- the rendered result list, the fetch envelope -- is one code path, so
each provider is normalised to the Serper (search) or Jina (fetch) shape before
anything reads it. The Serper and Jina branches are byte-identical to what
these tools always sent; do not tidy them into the others.
