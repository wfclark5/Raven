        The scan below reads text, so it can only refuse a path it can see, and
        a name is where a path hides: ``$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa`` put a letter in
        front of the ``/`` that :meth:`_extract_absolute_paths` looks for, and
        the whole command went through as naming no path at all. Expanding
        first is what puts the path back in view -- expanding afterwards, which
        is what this used to do, only ever saw candidates the scan had already
        passed.

        Three rules, each taken from the shell rather than invented:

        - **An unknown name is nothing.** ``$NOPE/etc/shadow`` *is*
          ``/etc/shadow``, and it is the case with no literal spelling to fall
          back on.
        - **The child's environment decides.** ``DirectExecutor`` hands over an
          allowlisted baseline, so a name outside that list arrives unset
          however this process reads it; ``os.environ`` would answer for a
          variable the command will never have.
        - **Single quotes expand nothing.** ``echo 'keys go in $HOME/.ssh'`` is
          a sentence, and refusing it would teach the operator to turn the
          fence off.

        A sandboxed executor runs somewhere with its own environment, which
        nothing here can read. The values are a host-side approximation there;
        the rule that carries is the first one, which needs no value to hold.
