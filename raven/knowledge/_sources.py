"""Data sources other than an uploaded file: a typed note, and a fetched page.

Both end up as markdown in the same blob store as every other document, so
nothing downstream -- parser table, chunker, indexer, preview -- learns a second
shape. What this module owns is getting them there: reading a page off the web,
and deciding what each is called in a list whose other rows are filenames.

The page fetch follows Cherry Studio's knowledge-base capture: Jina Reader,
which reads a page without a key, asked for JSON so the page's own title comes
back as a field rather than as a preamble to parse out of the text.
