"""One ACP connection: a child process, a read loop, and request correlation.

A connection is not a task. The agent's server is launched once and many tasks
run as ``session/prompt`` requests on it, which is the whole difference from the
cli transport (one process per task). Everything about keeping that process alive
lives here; deciding when to have one lives in the pool.

Process discipline is copied deliberately from
:class:`raven.agent.subagent.backends.cli_agent.CliAgentBackend`: own session, pgid
captured at spawn, ``killpg`` on teardown. An ACP server that reparents a worker
would otherwise survive ``proc.kill()`` exactly as a ``codex``-style CLI does.
