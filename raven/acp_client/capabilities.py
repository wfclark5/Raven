"""What an ACP agent says it can do, measured once and remembered.

This is the piece that makes an ``acp`` entry different in kind from a ``cli``
one. A cli entry's capabilities are seven fields a human typed, and the schema
can only catch them contradicting each other -- never being false. An acp entry
carries no such fields: raven connects, reads the ``initialize`` handshake, and
stores the answer.

The snapshot is what the roster reads, deliberately *not* a live handshake. A
roster that depended on a reachable process would let an agent vanish from the
model's options mid-session, and the model would then plan around a shrinking
list -- worse than a dispatch that fails with a clear error. This is the same
rule ``backends.enabled_third_party`` documents for ``enabled``.

Invalidation is by digest of the fields that decide how the agent is launched,
the mechanism :mod:`raven.agent.subagent.probe_state` already uses for test
verdicts: a stored snapshot whose digest no longer matches its config is treated
as absent rather than shown as current, which also covers a hand-edited
``config.json`` that no UI hook would see.
