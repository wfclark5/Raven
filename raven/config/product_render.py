"""The launcher library: render a product config and hand it to installed raven.

A product under ``agents/`` is a folder, not a fork: a published
``config.json``, a ``.env`` for secrets, and a launcher that renders the two
into a private copy and execs ``python -m raven acp``. What every such
launcher repeats is here -- reading a setting from the process environment
with a ``.env`` fallback, merging declared secret slots, inheriting the
host's LLM block when the product has no key of its own, pinning a state
root under the host's home and an engine home OUTSIDE it (the home lives in
the raven data directory, the work stays where the work is), seeding a
workspace file once, assembling the
``acp.modes`` catalogue from overlay files, sweeping stale renders by pid
liveness, and writing the rendered copy owner-only with the host's deny
rules merged in.

What stays in each product is its tables and its judgement: which secrets go
where, what its modes are called, how a mode's budget resolves, what must
refuse to launch. The split is deliberate -- the machine here is the trunk's
contract (config paths, the ``acp.modes`` shape, the rendered file's
location being load-bearing for the data dir), while every name in a table
is product vocabulary the trunk must not learn.

Importing this widens a launcher's import surface beyond the two kernel
symbols the first launcher deliberately limited itself to; that boundary was
given up knowingly (ruled 2026-08-31): a launcher execs this interpreter's
own raven anyway, so importing the library it is about to run adds no new
requirement.

    -- loading ``<mode>.json`` overlays, refusing unknown top-level keys,
    skipping a labeled mode whose overlay file is absent, and stamping the
    resolved cap into the entry so every mode declares its own budget (the
    baseline included, whose diff is empty but whose cap is not; the overlay
    carries no copy -- the loop tells its hooks the enforced cap directly as
    ``ctx.max_iterations``). ``resolve(overlay)`` is the product's half: it
    returns the
    mode's iteration cap and the diff the plugin should see -- both sides of
    vocabulary the trunk must not learn. An empty dict when the product ships
    no modes directory, which leaves ``acp.modes`` unset in the rendered
    config rather than absent from the schema: raven defaults an unset
    ``acp.modes`` to its own three built-in tiers, so ``session/set_mode``
    answers with those instead of method-not-found.
