"""Onboard's sub-agent step: set up the agent products that ship with raven.

``agents/`` holds one folder per product - a launcher (``run.py``) over the
installed raven, a ``config.json`` pinning the LLM it is tuned for, and a
``subagent.json`` manifest.

**Getting on the roster is not this step's job.**
:mod:`raven.agent.subagent.vendored_agents` discovers the tree and materializes a
row per folder on every table build, so an agent appears without being written
anywhere and disappears when its folder is deleted. What is left here is the part
that needs a human: choosing whether each product runs on its own key or inherits
the host's. A product whose readiness verdict says it cannot start (its launcher
file gone, its engine wheel not installed) has nothing this step can fix - the
reason is printed and the product skipped, because a key written for an agent
that cannot list would read as this step having broken something.

The tree is not a checkout-only thing: every wheel carries it, and it is
installed out to the raven home on first use so a product's ``.env`` survives an
upgrade. An install genuinely without it finds nothing and the step says so.

The choice offered per folder is not "working or not". An agent with no key of
its own still runs: its launcher copies the host's provider block whenever the
folder's own key is unset. What that costs is the model - inheritance brings the
host's `agents.defaults.model` along with its credentials, so the folder stops
running the one it was tuned for. A key of its own is the only way to keep it,
which is why the recommended model leads the menu.

Every folder is tuned for models served through OpenRouter, so a host that
already has an OpenRouter key needs no second copy of it: the step reuses that
one and asks nothing. The reuse is keyed on `providers.openrouter` specifically -
a key sitting in `custom` belongs to whatever private gateway that section points
at, and spending it against openrouter.ai would read as a bad credential rather
than as the configuration mistake it is.

One write remains the step's job: removing config rows that shadow a folder's
manifest (leftovers of the registration this step no longer performs). A stale
row outranks the discovered one, so pruning it is how an upgrade reaches the
roster; the prune backs the list up first and is skipped entirely in
non-interactive runs, like everything else here.
