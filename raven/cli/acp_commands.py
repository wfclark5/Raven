"""``raven acp``: the ACP agent's process shell.

An editor spawns this command and speaks newline-delimited JSON-RPC to its stdin

for the protocol, sending the logs somewhere else, opening stdin as a stream, and
making a crash visible -- because that part has to be right before any method can
work: the only bytes on stdout must be frames.

The protocol itself is :mod:`raven.acp.server`, which this hands the channel to.

_HELP = """Serve Raven as an ACP agent over stdio.

A client -- an editor, or another agent -- spawns this process and
speaks the Agent Client Protocol to its stdin and stdout:
newline-delimited JSON-RPC, one frame per line, protocolVersion 1. It
is not an interactive command: run bare in a terminal it waits for a
frame that never arrives. To drive it by hand, feed it a file with
`raven acp < session.jsonl`.
\b
Answered:
  session/new, session/load, session/resume, session/list,
  session/close, session/delete, session/prompt, session/cancel,
  session/set_config_option.
\b
Not answered:
  session/set_mode and logout are not implemented. A non-empty
  mcpServers on session/new or session/load is refused rather than
  ignored: MCP is connected once per process, and nothing scopes a
  server to one session.

A session takes its working directory from the cwd the client sends, so
there is no flag for it: session/new, session/load and session/resume
each require one and answer -32602 without it. Models switch through
session/set_config_option with category "model", which binds the
calling session alone and takes effect on its next turn --
session/set_model is not in the stable schema. playbook is announced
to the client as an available command. A frame over 8 MiB is answered
with an error and skipped, leaving the stream in sync.

Because stdout carries the protocol, logs go to a file:
<config dir>/logs/acp.log, rotating at 10 MB, 3 kept. stderr is left
to the client and carries WARNING and above; an unhandled failure
prints one line there and exits 1, with the traceback in the log.
\b
Environment:
  RAVEN_ACP_LOG_LEVEL  Level for the log file (default INFO).
                       --verbose outranks it. DEBUG makes LiteLLM
                       write each whole request as one record,
                       measured at 146 KiB on a single line.
  RAVEN_CLI_DEBUG      Also mirror DEBUG and above to stderr. With a
                       DEBUG file level, a client whose stderr reader
                       gives up on a line that long can deadlock this
                       process.
  RAVEN_HOME           Move the whole instance: config, logs, runtime
                       state. --config moves it for one run.
  RAVEN_SUBAGENT       1/true/yes/on says another raven launched this
                       process to answer one task for it, which
                       withholds the tools that hand work to a further
                       agent (spawn, run_subagent_dag, the graph
                       controls, the playbook pair) and says so in the
                       prompt. Set by the host on every child it
                       launches; set it yourself only to reproduce
                       what a sub-agent sees.

Design notes are in docs/specs, in the files named *-acp-*.

    Two paths, because ``connect_read_pipe`` does not accept every stdin. It

    cannot be paused) -- acceptable for the case that reaches it, which is a file
    of bounded size. An editor gets a pipe and never takes this branch.
